# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- (npm run dev) Command to run the application locally after installing the dependencies.
  

  Responsiveness -> UI is responsive for both desktop and mobile screens

  
  Code Reusibility -> I have create a slice for filters so that it can be accessed from any component
                   -> I have implemented different components like jobcards, filters so code is easy to understand

  Edge Cases  -> Like if in the api min-experience value is null then I have displayed a message in the card that freshers can also apply
              -> If the salary value in the api is null then I have displayed a message like it cannot be disclosed
